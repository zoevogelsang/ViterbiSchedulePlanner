The social sciences seek to explain the causes and consequences of a wide range of complex phenomena, including how individual and collective human action shapes and is shaped by economic organizations, political institutions, and social and cultural settings broadly understood. These phenomena include the role of gender, sexuality, race, class and other aspects of identity across time and settings in the United States and the world. Courses in this area will introduce students to analytical approaches and methods of social sciences, quantitative and/or qualitative, and how these insights can be brought to bear to better understand our social world.",

          "description": "Understanding the nature of scientific inquiry and the operation of the biological, physical, and technological world is essential for making personal and public policy decisions in a technological society. Courses in Life and Physical Sciences train students to understand the basic concepts and theories of science and the scientific method, with a major emphasis on the impact science has on society and the environment. Students learn about the process and methods underlying scientific inquiry, learn how to obtain accurate experimental results, are trained in the formulation of empirically-testable hypotheses, and then develop a basis for understanding the distinction between unsupported assertions versus conclusions based on sound scientific reasoning. As a result, all students should acquire substantive knowledge in science and technology, understand the processes by which scientists investigate and answer scientific questions, and be able to articulate the basic principles used to explain natural phenomena.",

They should have familiarity with many of the major scientific ideas of the modern world. Various forms of research skills characterize different disciplines, but all disciplines seek to foster techniques of research and investigation, analysis and problem-solving, that provides the basis for discovery and validation in their fields. In the sciences, such procedures are at the heart of specific methodologies of discovery and research and provide the means for confirmation and falsification of conjectures and hypotheses. USC students need to understand how data is generated, presented and interpreted and how scientific discovery spurs technology growth and impacts society. A science course at USC will include field, hands-on or laboratory experience in which data are collected, analyzed and interpreted.",

All Quantitative Reasoning courses, be they formal, abstract, or empirical, are designed to increase the capacity of students to evaluate chains of formal reasoning and to assess the validity of mathematical, logical, or statistical inferences. A course in this category aims to develop one or more of three sets of skills: formal reasoning (the use of formal logic or mathematics), abstract representation (the use or construction of symbolic or diagrammatic representations), and empirical analysis (the use of statistical inference).",
